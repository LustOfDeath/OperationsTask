How to run the application:

1. Run the query.py in order to create a database with already filled information.
2. Optional: you can run the crud_test.py in order to see if the database was created.
3. You can run the main.py which will create a RESTful API service which interacts with database.
4. Open the http://localhost:90(if the server information was not changed)

To know:
You can use the browser which lets to add, delete, edit, search by ID and shows all employees list
I was using the postman to test the routes, in order to create a new employee I had to use the x-www-form-urlencoded body
